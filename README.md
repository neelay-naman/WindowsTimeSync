# WindowsTimeSync

Funny story, I dual booted my laptop and now, every time I open Windows, I have to sync the time in setting which is a lazy thing for me to do.
I created this script to make that process 1 click away.

Just click on the file and run as administrator, and that will sync up your time with an NTP server.

Thanks for checking it out :)
